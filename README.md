# Approximate minimum-sized Vertex Cover Problem

- Designed three algorithms to compute vertex cover, first using CNF-SAT, second by picking highest degree vertex first, and third by picking random edge.
- Applied multithreading concept, by using three threads for above three algorithms and one for input-output of graph. So, all algorithms are executed concurrently and CMake is used for compilation of all files.   
- Plotted and analysed performance and efficiency of each algorithm using run time and approximation ratio and using GNU Plot.
